I am currently a Masters student at Binghamton University, pursuing a degree in the Masters of Anthropology: Public Archaeology (MAPA) program. This program prepares students for a career in cultural resource management (CRM). My interests in archaeology involve remote sensing techniques like the use of drones and satellite imaging. I am staunch believer of the use of non-invasive methods in archaeology so as to preserve the natural landscape, to not displace extant communities, and to save valuable resources. I believe archaeology is headed towards a future that will at least mostly, if not fully, rely on remote sensing techniques. I would very much like to contribute to this new wave in the practice of archaeology as my career progresses.
