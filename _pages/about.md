I am currently a Master's student at Binghamton University, pursuing a degree in the [Masters of Anthropology: Public Archaeology (MAPA)](https://www.binghamton.edu/anthropology/graduate/mapa/index.html) program. This program prepares students for a career in [cultural resource management (CRM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_resource_management). My interests in archaeology involve [remote sensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_sensing) techniques like the use of drones and satellite imaging. I am a staunch believer in the use of non-invasive methods in archaeology so as to preserve the natural landscape, to not displace extant communities, and to save valuable resources. I believe archaeology is headed towards a future that will at least mostly, if not fully, rely on remote sensing techniques. I would very much like to contribute to this new wave in the practice of archaeology as my career progresses.
